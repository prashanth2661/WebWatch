# WebWatch
WebWatch is an innovative Chrome extension designed to address the dual challenges of 
efficient time management and secure online exam supervision. This tool operates in two 
distinct modes - Normal Mode and Exam Mode - each tailored to specific user needs, thus 
offering a comprehensive solution for enhancing productivity and ensuring academic integrity. 
In Normal Mode, WebWatch empowers users to take control of their online activities by 
monitoring the time spent on various websites, setting customizable time limits, and triggering 
pop-up alerts when limits are exceeded. This fosters healthy browsing habits and ensures 
efficient time allocation across online activities. Exam Mode, on the other hand, addresses the 
growing need for secure online examination environments by enforcing strict measures to 
prevent cheating, such as full-screen mode enforcement, tab closure upon exit, and requiring 
an examiner-set password for activation. These features create a controlled and secure online 
examination environment that upholds academic integrity. WebWatch, therefore, stands out as 
a valuable tool for individuals and educational institutions, providing a practical approach to 
managing online activities and maintaining academic integrity.
